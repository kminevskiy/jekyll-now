### More Information

I've been in love with computers since I got my first PC in the early 90s. It was a pretty beaten up box with Intel 80486 inside. Loaded with DOS and Windows 95, this machine was full of "magic" and fascination. To understand it better, I started reading about operating systems and programming languages. I then experimented with operating systems installations, tried a few Linux distribution and was forced to wait for my father's IT friend to resurrect my lovely present (which stopped booting and was throwing cryptic error messages). That was my first experience with computers and debugging.

In late 2000s I worked as an IT helpdesk support. That gave me enough experience to transition to junior system administrator. There I was exposed to various technical environments (Windows, Linux, large tape backup systems, numerous Cisco networking devices). It was an amazing time to learn some of these technologies inside out!

While writing scripts and small utilities could be fun, I wanted to be involved in actual software development. That's why in 2016 I decided to transition to a career in software engineering. With the help from [Launch School](launchschool.com), I am now learning how to be a serious web developer! In the last year I learned a lot about web-dev in general as well as various technologies, languages and frameworks, like Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Javascript (Backbone), SQL, Python and many others.

Now I'm looking for a serious company I could contribute to, work on sophisticated engineering problems and make this world a better place!
