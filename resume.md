### Objectives

Software engineer with passion for great, impactful solutions is looking for a serious company to contribute to, work on sophisticated engineering problems and make this world a better place!

### Skills

As a web-developer, I’ve been working with various languages, frameworks and tools. I used Ruby frameworks like Sinatra and Ruby on Rails to build different projects (both in terms of scope and complexity), such as Netflix-like application (with 3rd party services integration such as payment processing, business email providers, etc), Trello-inspired front-end app (heavy use of Backbone, jQuery, templating engines) and its back-end part written in JavaScript via Node’s Express web framework. To persist application’s data I used PostgreSQL RDBMS.

As a system administrator, I have experience working with numerous operating systems, including almost all imaginable GNU/Linux distributions, Windows Server[2003-2016] and OS X. To efficiently manage my IT infrastructure I used popular monitoring tools like Nagios and Icinga.
