### Objectives

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software engineer with passion for great, impactful solutions. For the most part, I work with Ruby and JavaScript, but at the same time I consider myself language agnostic – I love to learn new tools regardless of the underlying framework/language. Most recently, I co-developed [Workerholic](https://workerholic.github.io/), a highly scalable background job processor written in Ruby.

### Skills

* Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, SQL
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis
* Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Backbone, VueJS, Sinatra
* OS: GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows Server

### Selected Project: Workerholic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workerholic is a multi-threaded, multi-process background job processing manager. It allows developers to decouple their application processing logic into a separate, self-sufficient process. Once installed and configured, Workerholic will take care of any time-consuming tasks that your application may have, be it “talking” to an external API, performing CPU-heavy calculations or simply running millions of these tasks together.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other features, Workerholic includes automatic load balancing, command-line interface, delayed jobs scheduler, multi-process operations, reporting web interface and full Ruby on Rails integration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow this [link](https://workerholic.github.io/) to read more about Workerholic and our story.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology stack: Ruby, Redis, Rails, JavaScript, Heroku
