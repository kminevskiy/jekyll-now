### Latest Project: Workerholic

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Workerholic](https://workerholic.github.io/) is a multi-process, multi-threaded background job processor written in Ruby. It does the heavy lifting for any web application by working on the CPU or IO-intensive tasks in the background. By running in a separate process, completely independent from the main application, Workerholic provides convenient way to decouple time-consuming processing from the business logic of your application. Let your application handle normal requests and Workerholic will take care of the rest.
